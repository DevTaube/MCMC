# Minecraft Motion Controls
Have you ever been playing Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition on your PC while looking at your Nintendo Switch JoyCons and thinking to yourself: "Man, I'd really love to play this game with motion controls..."?
Yep, me neither. I made it anyway! 

# Requirements
- A pair of Nintendo Switch JoyCons
- Bluetooth connectivity on your PC
- [Betterjoy](https://github.com/Davidobot/BetterJoy) installed
- A copy of Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition (as it is the only one to officially support controllers)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed

# Controls
What controls have changed? Well, its relatively simple.
- Default Xbox-One Controller Layout
- Swing the left JoyCon in the air to break blocks / hit stuff
- Swing the right one to place blocks / interact with stuff

# How to use (setting up the controllers)
For those of you who already connected their Joycons to their PC and got Betterjoy working (to a state where they can play the game with them), skip ahead to the next section. 
1. Connect your JoyCons to your PC via Bluetooth
2. Download [Betterjoy](https://github.com/Davidobot/BetterJoy), extract it, run the driver installer in the drivers folder and then run the program (the JoyCons should be detected)
3. Launch Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition to test it

# How to use (using the python script)
When using it the first time, run *setup.bat*.
There is also a *config.yml* if you want to mess with the program.
If you want to uninstall all modules that this program uses run *uninstall.bat*.
If python is in your path, just run on *run.bat*. If it isn't, either create a batch file yourself or run in manually from the command line.
Quickly change the window to Minecraft, wait for the cooldown to end and have fun!
