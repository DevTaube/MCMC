# Minecraft Motion Controls
Have you ever been playing Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition on your PC while looking at your Nintendo Switch JoyCons and thinking to yourself: "Man, I'd really love to play this game with motion controls..."?
Yep, me neither. I made it anyway! 

# Requirements
- A pair of Nintendo Switch JoyCons
- Bluetooth connectivity on your PC
- [Betterjoy](https://github.com/Davidobot/BetterJoy) installed
- A copy of Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition (as it is the only one to officially support controllers)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed

# Controls
What controls have changed? Well, its relatively simple.
- Default Xbox-One Controller Layout
- Swing the left JoyCon in the air to break blocks / hit stuff
- Swing the right one to place blocks / interact with stuff

# How to use (setting up the controllers)
For those of you who already connected their Joycons to their PC and got Betterjoy working (to a state where they can play the game with them), skip ahead to the next section. 
1. Connect your JoyCons to your PC via Bluetooth
2. Download [Betterjoy](https://github.com/Davidobot/BetterJoy), extract it, run the driver installer in the drivers folder and then run the program (the JoyCons should be detected)
3. Launch Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition to test it

# How to use (using the python script)
Now to the good part. When you have downloaded the program, keep every file together in the same directory.
If you want, you can change the settings in the config.yml file. I wouldn't change it tho, just to be sure.
All you have to do now is run the batchfile and it should run. It could happen that it doesn't run because Python is stored as "python3" and not "python" in your path.
If thats the case just quickly edit the batchfile. Quickly change the window to Minecraft, wait for the cooldown to end and have fun!
